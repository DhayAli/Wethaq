 "Wethaq" Graduation Project

Computer Science | Umm Al-Qura University
Built using Django

"Wathaq" is a digital system that aims to digitize detainee transactions at the Public Prosecution. It replaces traditional methods that can lead to delays and human errors, providing an integrated system that facilitates searching for detainee records, tracks updates, and ensures data accuracy, making legal procedures faster and more efficient. During the development of "Wathaq," we faced many challenges, from designing a flexible and comprehensive database and building an easy-to-use user interface to improving search performance. Despite the difficulties, this journey was a wonderful one, full of learning and discovery, and we gained a lot of experience.
